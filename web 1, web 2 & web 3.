here are five characteristics and functionality of
Web 1.0, web 2 and web 3: Static Content

Characterized by static web pages with limited interactivity.
Content consumption-centric, where users mainly read information presented by websites.
Websites were primarily created and managed by individuals or organizations, with little user contribution.
Limited multimedia integration, mostly text and basic graphics.
Examples include early websites like those from the 1990s, where browsing was primarily one-way.
Web 2.0: Dynamic User Participation

Transition towards dynamic, interactive web experiences.
User-generated content becomes prominent, with platforms enabling collaboration, interaction, and sharing.
Social media platforms, wikis, blogs, and forums emerge, facilitating user engagement and contribution.
Integration of multimedia content becomes widespread, including images, videos, and interactive elements.
Personalization and customization options allow users to tailor their web experiences.
Examples include social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, where users actively participate in content creation and sharing.
Web 3.0: Decentralization and Semantic Web

Focuses on decentralization, interoperability, and machine-readable data.
Embraces blockchain technology and decentralized protocols to enhance security, privacy, and trust.
Semantic web technologies enable data to be understood and processed by machines, leading to more intelligent and context-aware applications.
Emphasis on linked data, enabling seamless integration and exchange of information across different platforms and services.
Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) enable new business models and decentralized governance structures.
Examples include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, blockchain-based identity solutions, and AI-driven personalized services that leverage semantic web technologies.
